# rTGV(relaxed total generalized variation)-mesh-denoising
This project provides the code of paper "A Novel Mesh Denoising Method Based on Relaxed Second-Order Total Generalized Variationâ€œ.
The code is realized by VS2010 + Openmesh 2.2 + Eigen + gmm.
The main file  is "Mesh.h, Mesh.cpp" and the main function is "almMeshSmoothing(...)".
